Player/Dealer Correlation
--------------------------


After an analysis of the roulette casino game, it has 
been determined that there was collusion involved between one
of our dealers, Billy Jones, and a player, Mylie Schmidt.

An analysis was first done to see when the losses occurred. 
They happened on March 10, March 13, and March 15.  Once the days
were discovered, it was determined that the losses occurred at the
same times: 5AM, 8AM, 2PM, 8PM, and 11PM.  On March 15th, however, there
were no losses at 8PM and 11PM.

Once the times were discovered, an analysis was done to see who was 
playing and dealing at those times.  Strangely enough, Mylie Schmidt 
played at all the times and dates of the losses.  One of our dealers,
Billy Jones, was a dealer at the same days and times that Mylie Schmidt played.

The fact that these losses occurred at the same days and times Mylie Schmidt
and Billy Jones were present at the roulette casino game were highly unusual.
Something must be going on.  It is the conclusion of this report that there
was something nefarious going on and we should report to this to the local
authorities.
